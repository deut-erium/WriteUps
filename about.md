This page is concerned about explaining how to use the writeups

## [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps)
I try to make all my writeups with love, if you loved them too, I would be
glad if you left some stars :D


All the blogs (and after a lot of pain, links too!) here are in-sync with the 
### [GitHub repo _posts](https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps/tree/master/_posts)

The content is organised in the hierarchy
- year (2020, 2021 etc)
    - ctf_name (e.g. cyber_apocalypse)
      - category (e.g. crypto)
        - challenge_name
          - description.md
          - DATE-challenge_name.md
          - solve.py (mostly or whatever solve code)
          - source files

And so will be a path to writeup  
`https://deut-erium.github.io/WriteUps/year/ctf_name/category/challenge_name/link`  

I will try to make all the solve scripts and challenge files downloadable  
by clicking in the links on the writeup so as to ease setup and testing the  
solution scripts!  

### [GitHub repo _drafts](https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps/tree/master/_drafts)  
Should contain the same hierarchy as the writeups post. This path should  
contain all the files I worked with in a CTF, including solved an unsolved  
challenges.

If you are in luck, you can definitely find my dirty scripts and solutions  
which I wanted to but felt too lazy writing up!

- year (2020, 2021 etc)
    - ctf_name (e.g. cyber_apocalypse)
      - category (e.g. crypto)
        - challenge_name
          - description.md
          - DATE-challenge_name.md (most probably not)
          - solve.py (typically trash script)
          - source files
