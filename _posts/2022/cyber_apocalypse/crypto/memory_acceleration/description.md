Memory Acceleration
While everyone was asleep, you were pushing the capabilities of your technology to the max. Night after night, you frantically tried to repair the encrypted parts of your brain, reversing custom protocols implemented by your father, wanting to pinpoint exactly what damage had been done and constantly keeping notes because of your inability of forming new memories. On one of those nights, you had a flashback. Your father had always talked about a new technology and how it would change the galaxy. You realized that he had used it on you. This technology dealt with a proof of a work function and decentralized networks. Along with Virgil’s help, you had a “Eureka!” moment, but his approach, brute forcing, meant draining all your energy. Can you find a quicker way to validate new memory blocks?
