Eric has an elliptic curve defined over a Galois field with order 404993569381. A generator point (391109997465, 167359562362) is given along with a public key (209038982304, 168517698208). We also know that the curve is defined as y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (mod p), and that b is equal to 54575449882. What is Ericâ€™s private key? Express the key as an integer in base 10. Use the flag format flag{+private_key+}.
