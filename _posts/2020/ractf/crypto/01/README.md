We have to solve the cipher.
Considering the level and monoalphabetic substitution i.e each alphabet
is replaced with other alphabet. 

Quickly verifying my hypothesis by checking on [quipquip](https://quipqiup.com/) I found the plaintext

```
AGENT ITS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HER E WEVE FOUND OUT THAT SOME EMPL OYEES OF EVIL CORP HAVE BEEN SE NDING SECRET 
MESSAGES BETWEE N EACH OTHER BUT THEYRE ENCRYP TED WERE GOING TO NEED TO DECRY PT THEM TO WORK OUT IF THERES 
SO METHING ILLEGAL GOING ON AND G ET THEM ARRESTED NORMALY THE C RYPTOGRAPHY TEAM WOULD DO THI S BUT THEYVE 
ALL DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME TO GO ON ANUAL LEAVE B EST OF LUCK AGENT B THE SECRET C ODE IS DOCUMENTS
```
Correcting spaces a bit, we get the text [decrypted.txt](decrypted.txt)
```
AGENT ITS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE WEVE FOUND OUT THAT SOME EMPLOYEES OF EVIL CORP HAVE BEEN SENDING 
SECRET MESSAGES BETWEEN EACH OTHER BUT THEYRE ENCRYPTED WERE GOING TO NEED TO DECRYPT THEM TO WORK 
OUT IF THERES SOMETHING ILLEGAL GOING ON AND GET THEM ARRESTED NORMALY THE CRYPTOGRAPHY TEAM WOULD 
DO THIS BUT THEYVE ALL DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME TO GO ON ANUAL LEAVE BEST OF LUCK AGENT B THE SECRET 
CODE IS DOCUMENTS
```

Hence the code we are looking for is **DOCUMENTS**

Alternatively, you may look up the video writeup by @hyperreality on puzzles `01-06`, they were quite informative, given that I got stuck at `04`
