## Contributing as a collaborator
This repository uses jekyll theme [TeXt](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/docs/en/quick-start), check out the documentation for features and syntax.  
All the posts are stored in [_posts](_posts) directory, creating a file `YYYY-MM-DD-name.md` creates a url `/YYYY/MM/DD/name.html` in the github pages.  
To create a new post, just create a new file of the specified format.

### Not a collaborator?
Create a fork and issue a pull request with the repository. Make sure the branch you are working on is updated with the master branch. If you feel you would be a regular contributor, just feel free to let us know so that we can add you as collaborator! 

### Not sure if you want to publish directly?
Create the same file with specified format in [_drafts](_drafts) (create if directory not available)

### Showcase your work
You can showcase your work by having an author badge at the bottom which can be configured to display your profile (name, bio, github, twitter, linkedin etc).
Just navigate to [_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml) and append your details (take hints from pre existing author details).

> Note: Undesired files (not to be shown on the website) or paths should be added in the `exclude` variable in [_config.yml](_config.yml)

## [Front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
Each post page has a beginning element called frontmatter which is enclosed in `---`  
This yaml is configuration of the current page.

## Creating an assignment
Assignment will be just another article page, with tasks in it.  
The files required for the task need to be put into [assignments](assignemts) directory in a directory which is name of the article.  
For each task, calculate the sha256 of the flag and put it in the `sha256hash` array in frontmatter.  
Put the tags
```
{% assign index = 0 %}
{% include checkflag.html %}
```
To specify index of the task and include a flag input box!  
Check out [what are assignments.md](https://github.com/CSEA-IITB/IITBreachers-wiki/blob/master/_posts/2020-07-17-what%20are%20assignments.md) for an example.  

Well thats all it takes to contribute and publish your article :smile:  
Expecting cool contributions!
