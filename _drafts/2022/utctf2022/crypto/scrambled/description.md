# Scrambled

 I dropped my friend's keyboard and all the key caps fell off. I didn't want them to find out what happened, so I put the key caps back on in random places... Good news: My friend only looks at the keyboard when they type, so they didn't notice that they were typing absolute gibberish. Bad news: They were supposed to send me a flag, but instead I got... this... Can you help me figure out it was supposed to be? By oops (@oops on discord)
