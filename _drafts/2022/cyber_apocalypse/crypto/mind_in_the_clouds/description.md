Mind In The Clouds
Mysterious kidnappings of Longhir’s best scientists began to occur ever since Draeger gained influence in the council, a fact known to everyone in the troupe. Virgil was certain that these kidnappings had something to do with Meiro and the neuro-linked technology he helped develop. He also knew that Draeger wanted to experiment by uploading minds to the cloud and then connecting them to androids. These thoughts ran through Miyuki’s mind while she was searching for clues in the prison. After finding no signs that indicated a physical escape, she concluded that Draeger hadn’t actually escaped. Instead, he had somehow initiated a backup version of his mind, which he had downloaded into an unknown body. Upon hearing Miyuki’s conclusions, the team was in a rather charged mood. As you sit in the corner, almost paralyzed by the crippling news, you can only think of one thing: Is your father in the cloud/s too?
