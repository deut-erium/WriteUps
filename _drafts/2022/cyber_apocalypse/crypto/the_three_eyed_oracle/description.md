The Three-Eyed Oracle
Feeling very frustrated for getting excited about the AI and not thinking about the possibility of it malfunctioning, you blame the encryption of your brain. Feeling defeated and ashamed to have put Miyuki, who saved you, in danger, you slowly walk back to the lab. More determined than ever to find out what’s wrong with your brain, you start poking at one of its chips. This chip is linked to a decision-making algorithm based on human intuition. It seems to be encrypted… but some errors pop up when certain user data is entered. Is there a way to extract more information and fix the chip?
