MOVs Like Jagger
While following the breadcrumbs from the secret messages you managed to recover from Broider, Bonnie gathered more information from his well trusted “Tsirakia” and found out that the messages were about the destinations of a STS (Space Transportation Ship). The STS, named “Paketo”, is a notoriously large spaceship that transports military supplies for the Golden Fang mercenary army. After spending some time observing the seemingly random trajectory of Paketo, you and Paulie manually plotted the delivery locations and realized that the STS’s orbit forms an elliptic curve. Your spaceship’s advanced technology GPS has calculated the exact parameters of the curve. Can you somehow predict Paketo’s final destination and hijack it?
