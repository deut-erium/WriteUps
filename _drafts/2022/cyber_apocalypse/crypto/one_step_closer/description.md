One Step Closer
Reading out loud Danbeer’s thoughts from the cloud server shocked everyone. Knowing that your father has become a consciousness that can be easily turned off and on is traumatizing. You are overwhelmed by your feelings and angry at yourself. You begin to ask yourself. Why am I feeling so much pain? Is there a part of my brain that is still encrypted? Have I screwed up again? You run towards the lab while shouting and slamming the doors behind you. Upon seeing that, Ulysses immediately flees the spaceship. Many days have passed and you are still obsessed with finding the part of your brain that needs to be repaired. Your comrades are startled by your sudden introversion and worry about Ulysses, who is nowhere to be seen. Weeks have passed and Ulysses is still missing. Suddenly, the ship receives a docking signal and as you scan the alien spacecraft for signs of life, a male passenger is discovered. It’s Ulysses! Excited, he rushes out of his capsule and overtakes the crew members, that longed to hug him to get to your lab. Ulysses informs you that he has managed to steal one of the cloud backup servers from the facility where the experiments took place. It seems that this device alters the consciousness of each test subject. Stunned by this information, a realization comes to mind. You are going to get your father back.
