Find Marher's Secret
After figuring out the destination of Paketo, Ulysses devised a hijacking plan to sabotage the delivery of the military equipment. Despite efforts, the plan did not work as expected and a battle ensued. Since your movement was restricted, Miyuki ordered you to hide behind a huge container with unknown contents in fear of taking more damage. Seeing all the killings of the manipulated cyborgs (code named: Marher) brought back memories of your time on the graveyard planet. Suddenly, a cyborg appeared in front of you. Unable to move from the shock, death was all you could think about. Fortunately, Ulysses manages to save you at the last second by knocking the cyborg unconscious. You bring it back to the laboratory to use some of its functionalities to repair parts of your brain. You discover that all of its components are encrypted. Can you find a way to extract the secret key?
