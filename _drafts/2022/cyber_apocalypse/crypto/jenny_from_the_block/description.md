Intrigued by the fact that you have found something your father made, and with much confidence that you can be useful to the team, you rush excitedly to integrate “Jenny” into the spaceship’s main operating system. For weeks, everything went smoothly, until you ran into a meteor storm. Having little to no data of training, the AI is now malfunctioning. Ulysses freaks out because he can no longer control the spaceship due to the AI overriding his manual commands. Big banging noises terrify your crew members. Everything is shaking. It’s time to act. Do you think you can temporarily shut down “Jenny” until she becomes more sophisticated?
