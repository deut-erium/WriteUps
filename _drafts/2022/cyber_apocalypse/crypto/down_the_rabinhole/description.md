Down the Rabinhole
Miyuki, wanting to find out more evidence about Draeger and his escape, planned a space trip to the maximum security black hole where Draeger was held captive. Problems though soon arose as the approach to the black hole caused distortions on your electronics. Memories of the traumatic experience you had when the Council guards brutally ripped you from your father’s hands painfully flooded your mind. The one thing you never forgot was the signal he sent you while you were still within range of the planet. Only two packets got through, but since they were encrypted you couldn’t figure out what they were. Now, being more determined than ever to find your father, having gained experience during the missions with the squad, you know that it’s time to decrypt the signal.
