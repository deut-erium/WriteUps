Challenge type: Cryptography

Description: I was working with SageMath[1] as a newbie. That is an open source mathematics software system. I was learning about the `nth_root' functionality, but I confronted with a weird and maybe wrong result!!! [1]: https://www.sagemath.org

Please see below. Can you help me to find the right flag?
