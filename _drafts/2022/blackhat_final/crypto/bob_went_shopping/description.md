Your friends Alice, Bob, and Charlie have solved a CTF challenge and found the flag. They are willing to share it with you if they all agree. But it seems Bob has gone AFK... Maybe you can convince them that Bob agrees to giving you to flag?

Note: When you get the flag, please insert a colon ":" 4 characters in, and then another 2 more characters after that.

Example: FLAG{123456supercoolflag} is what you would get, but you need to submit FLAG{1234:56:supercoolflag}.
