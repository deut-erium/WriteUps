 CPA-Secure Diffie–Hellman?
500
@Author: OPz qt Hard

Alice and Bob have implemented their own CPA-Secure Diffie–Hellman key exchange in an effort to ensure nobody can send messages to Alice that appear to be signed by Bob. Their prime is large and they are using sha-256. Despite this someone is impersonating Bob. He is convinced someone has constructed a second pre-image attack on sha-256. Do you agree with his conclusion?
