My mate has to sign a lot of documents, so she automated the process, but is too careful when talking about cookies. Also, since last Nullcon in April, she has completely rewritten her code. She now uses Elliptic Curve crypto, so all my previous knowledge does not help me any more. However, I still need a proof of her cookies addiction. Can you help me?

Her automatic signature service runs under
