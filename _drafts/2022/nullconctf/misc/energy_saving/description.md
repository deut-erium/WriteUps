Facing both the energy crisis cause by Russia's war and Global Warming, we have to save energy wherever we can. So, for my RSA decryption I only have a single register, can load one other value from memory and I am allowed a limited number of modular multiplications. Can you help me decrypt the message I got? If it's nothing private, I will share it with you. I even give you my private key.
