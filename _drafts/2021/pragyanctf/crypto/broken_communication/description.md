## 150

 You along with your squad are stuck in a bunker. The only way to communicate with the Army Chief is to revert the encrypted code sent by him. All you were supposed to do was to take the encrypted code and decrypt it using the using the machine provided. However due to some problem the machine is giving out only the last bit of the message.

Can you still manage to establish a communication and save your squad?
