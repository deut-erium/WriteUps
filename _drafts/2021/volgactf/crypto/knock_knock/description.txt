Desynchronized with the current configuration of our knockd server, we are unable to connect to it. Fortunately, we've managed to record some of the server's network traffic, hoping it might help up somehow...

Can you take a look?

task.py knockd.pcap

N.B. The flag is a string of the form "VolgaCTF{a,b}", where a and b are the current ports from '[openSSH]' configuration block
