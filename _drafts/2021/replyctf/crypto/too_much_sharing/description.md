Mixantula is the Legend of Tech. From the Temple of Nebula she watches over her companions and sends them support. For this, she needs your help!

Mixantula is now facing a new communication problem with her companions, especially Claire. To restore all communications with her, she needs to intercept Edgard, one of the enemies, who knows part of the code to restore the connections.

    ...
    Edgard = int(str(Portia)[0:32])+int(str(Quincy)[0:32])
    while not isPrime(Edgard):
        Edgard += 1
    ...

Help our Hero find out where Edgard and his henchmen, Nathan and Philip, are hiding Portia and Quincy, who hold the key to interpreting what Claire says.
