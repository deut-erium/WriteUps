Welcome to the Carnival! 

Here's how you play games here. Since too many players forge their own
version of our previous generation of Carnival tokens, we now use the new 
tokens called "Medallions". You have a few options:
    - Purchase a medallion for $1000.
    - Get $999 in cash back for a medallion.
    - Use a medallion to play games.
Although not necessary for our business, we still offer some internal 
operations for medallions. If you just wanna have some fun at the Carnival,
you probably don't need them (~unless you have some peculiar sense of fun):
    - Refresh/void all previous medallions in exchange for a new one, for $1.
    - Test on medallions internally: flipping bits, viewing bits, you name it!
If you attempt to cheat at our Carnival, we will NOT hesitate before
calling the cops on you. Be warned! 

Also, we communicate only via JSON. Hope that's easy for ya. Here's an example
sequence of messages we will understand:
{"option": "help"}
{"option": "money_for_med"}
{"option": "play_razzle", "med_id": <med_id from previous result>}
