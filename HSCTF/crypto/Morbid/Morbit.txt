MORBIT (50-75 plaintext letters)

Choose a  9-letter  keyword  to  set  up an  array  as  shown.  Plaintext  is  enciphered
exactly  as in  the  Fractionated  Morse,  x  between  letters,  xx  between  words.  The
result is then taken off in units of 2, placed vertically, and numbers are taken from
the array to form the ciphertext. Numbers represent alphabetical order of the key. (It
is often as easy to read pairs horizontally as to rearrange them vertically.) Morse
code letters, numbers, and punctuation can be found in Appendix 1.
