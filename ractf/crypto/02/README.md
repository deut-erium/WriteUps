Progressing from [01](https://github.com/deut-erium/WriteUps/tree/master/ractf/crypto/01) we get to `02` and are presented with the following ciphertext

Expecting the level to increase slightly, the first guess is [Vignere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)

Without wasting time lets go to [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to see if it works, and it confidently spews out the [plaintext](decrypted.txt)

The flag is the location of the bank
```
and the key `TRAFFIC`

rearranging the spaces, we get
```
ROCCO I VE TRANSFERED THE
FIRST PART OF THE FUNDS TO YOU RACCO
UNT BUT I M GOING TO NEED TO SEE

MEETING POINT AND COMPLETE THE DEAL YOURS DONNIE
```
And we can see people talking about **ZURICH** which is the place we seek as the location of the bank
