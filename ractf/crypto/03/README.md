# 03

We are now provided with another cipher, and like [02]() and [01](),
we dont know what cipher is it.

The first thing while dealing with simple ciphers is checking [letter frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency).  
Heading to frequency analysis section of [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis)
|Letter|Count|Percentage|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|E| 80×|14.49%|
|T| 50×|9.06%|
|O| 48×|8.7% |
|I| 40×|7.25%|
|A| 39×|7.07%|
|S| 34×|6.16%|
|N| 31×|5.62%|
|R| 29×|5.25%|
|H| 27×|4.89%|
|L| 23×|4.17%|
|C| 21×|3.8% |
|U| 18×|3.26%|
|P| 16×|2.9% |   
|D| 15×|2.72%|
|M| 15×|2.72%|
|G| 12×|2.17%|
|W| 12×|2.17%|
|B| 12×|2.17%|
|F| 9× |1.63%|
|Y| 9× |1.63%|
|V| 7× |1.27%|
|K| 5× |0.91%|

Comparing the above distribution, one could easily tell that no substitution is involved (hopefully), which means the given thing would be [transposition cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher).

Thinking of various transposition ciphers, the first one which comes in mind [railfence cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher#Rail_Fence_cipher). 
Once again, I am asking for help from [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/rail-fence-cipher), and it does help (with removed punctuations and spaces option)
to give out [plaintext](decrypted.txt)

Key `Railfence size 5, offset 3, from bottom`  
Putting correct spaces, we can read
```
AGENT GREAT WORK WITH THE FIRST MESSAGE I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE CAESAR CIPHER IT LOOKS LIKE EVIL CORP ARE DEFINITELY UP TO
SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ROCCO AND DONNIE BOTH APPEAR TO BE SENIOR MEMBERS OF
THE COMPANY BOARD SO THIS COULD BE REALLY BIG WE MANAGED TO INTERCEPT
ANOTHER MESSAGE BETWEEN THE MBUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY VE INCREASED THEIR
SECURITY A BIT MORE THE CRYPTOLOGISTS ARE STILL ON LEAVE AND NONE OF THEM
ARE RESPONDING TO THEIR EMAIL I ASSUME WE CAN CONTINUE TO COUNT ON YOU FOR
THESE WHEN WE FOUND THE MESSAGE IT CAME WITH A SLIP OF PAPER WHICH I VE
INCLUDED A PHOTO OF FOR YOU ALL THE BEST AGENT B THE SECRET CODE IS
ANUALLEAVE WITHOUT ANYSPACES
```
And **ANNUALLEAVE** is finally the secret code which we seek
