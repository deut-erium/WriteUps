The flag is the 2nd and 3rd 9 letter words concatenated together

The first thing while dealing with simple ciphers is checking [letter frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency).
Heading to frequency analysis section of [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/frequency-analysis)
|Letter|Count|Percentage|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|E| 53×|13.38%|
|T| 38×|9.6% |
|O| 34×|8.59%|
|S| 31×|7.83%|
|A| 28×|7.07%|
|N| 27×|6.82%|
|Y| 23×|5.81%|
|I| 20×|5.05%|
|D| 18×|4.55%|
|H| 17×|4.29%|
|R| 17×|4.29%|
|M| 14×|3.54%|
|L| 13×|3.28%|
|U| 11×|2.78%|
|C| 10×|2.53%|
|G| 8× |2.02%|
|W| 8× |2.02%|
|B| 7× |1.77%|
|P| 6× |1.52%|
|X| 4× |1.01%|
|F| 3x |0.76%|
|V| 3× |0.51%|
|K| 2× |0.51%|
|Z| 1x |0.25%|
|J| 1x |0.25%|

This cipher turned out to be [Columnar Shift cipher](), A good visual solver for the same turns out to be [this site](http://tholman.com/other/transposition/)

Fixing spaces in the plaintext, we get,
```
DONNIE I AGREE THAT MEETING IN PERSON MAY BE THE BEST WAY TO COMPLETE 
THIS DEAL I DO NOT TRUST MY MEN WITH THE GOODS ANYWAY WHEN HANDLING THE
GOODS YESTERDAY AN ITEM BIT TOO HARD AND BLED OUT OVER THE FLOOR THE MESS
WAS CRAZY AND I REALLY JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE THE GOODS OFF MY HANDS AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE I M CONCERNED THAT THIS LINE MAY BE TAPPED SO WE SHOULD 
INCREASE OUT SECURITY MEASURES MY NEXT MESSAGE TO YOU WILL BE ENCRYPTED 
USING THE KEY MY ENVOY SENT YOU YESTERDAY SINCERELY ROCCO XXX
```

This is the list of all 9 letter words, we have to take 2nd and 3rd to form the flag
```python
['YESTERDAY', 'CONCERNED', 'ENCRYPTED', 'YESTERDAY', 'SINCERELY']
```
